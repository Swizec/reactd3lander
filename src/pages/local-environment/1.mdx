# Set up a local environment with create-react-app

In the summer of 2016, the React team released a tool called
`create-react-app`. It creates a React app so that you can get started right
away. All of the code in this course runs with an app set up like this.

Getting started with React has never been easier.

1. Make sure you have node.js
2. Install the app generator
3. Run the app generator

## Make sure you have node.js

Modern JavaScript development runs on node.js. Your code still ends up in a
browser, but there are a few steps it has to go through before it gets there.
Those toolchains run on node.js.

Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/), download one of the latest
versions, and run the installer. You can pick the more stable LTS
(long-term-support) version, or the more gimme-all-the-features version.
JavaScript toolchains run fine in both.

Server-side rendering might be easier with the fancy-pants version. More on
that later.

## Install create-react-app

Great, you have node and you're ready to go.

Run this command in a terminal:

```
$ npm install -g create-react-app
```

This installs a global npm package called `create-react-app`. Its job is to
create a directory and install `react-scripts`.

Confusing, I know.

You can think of `create-react-app` and `react-scripts` as two parts of the
same construction. The first is a lightweight script that you can install
globally and never update; the second is where the work happens. You want this
one to be fresh every time you start a new app.

Keeping a global dependency up to date would suck, especially considering there
have been six major updates since Facebook first launched `create-react-app` in
July 2016.

## Run create-react-app

Superb! You have `create-react-app`. Time to create an app and get started with
some coding.

Run this in a terminal:

```
$ create-react-app reactdataviz-project
```

Congratulations! You just created a React app. _With_ all the setup and the
fuss that goes into using a modern JavaScript toolchain.

Your next step is to run your app:

```
$ cd reactdataviz-project
$ npm start
```

A browser tab should open with a blank page and a spinning React logo.

If that didn't work, then something must have gone terribly wrong. You should
consult
[the official docs](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Maybe that will help.
