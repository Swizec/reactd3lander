# Install dependencies for React for Datavisualization

<Vimeo id={429501405} />

There are a couple of libraries we're going to use often in this book: D3,
Topojson, and Lodash. We're using D3 to do our heavy lifting, Topojson to parse
geographical data, and Lodash to make data manipulation easier.

You can install them like this:

```{caption="Install dependencies"}
$ npm install --save d3 topojson lodash
```

Additionally, we're using Bootstrap for default styling and String for string
manipulation. You should install them as well.

```{caption="Styling and string manipulation"}
$ npm install --save bootstrap string
```

Now your environment is ready! You should see a default React App page in the
browser without errors. Keep `npm start` running as you follow the examples in
this book.

Some examples are going to need other libraries. When that happens, I'll remind
you to install them.
