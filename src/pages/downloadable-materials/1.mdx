👋

At one point I was going to offer aphysical book version of React for Data Visualization. The logistics didn't work out and every print-on-demand service I could find was kind of shit. Either the paper would suck or the print quality would be terrible. Not the kind of product I want to sign my name on.

Instead you can download the PDF, epub, or mobi version for your favorite ebook reader. You can even print them out as I've heard some people do. That's a lot of paper, though, so I hope you reconsider :)

Enjoy,

~Swizec

## Prep for launch

You’ve built a great visualization. Congratz! Time to put it online and share with the world.

To do that, we’re going to use Github Pages because our app is a glorified static website. There’s no backend, so all we need is something to serve our HTML, JavaScript, and CSV. Github Pages is perfect for that.

It’s free, works well with create-react-app, and can withstand a lot of traffic. You don’t want to worry about traffic when your app gets to the top of HackerNews or Reddit.

There are a few things we should take care of:

- setting up deployment
- adding a page title
- adding some copy
- Twitter and Facebook cards
- an SEO tweak for search engines
- use the full dataset

## Setting up deployment

You’ll need a Github repository. If you’re like me, writing all this code without version control or off-site backup made you nervous, so you already have one.

For everyone else, head over to Github, click the green ``` New Repository ``` button and give it a name. Then copy the commands it gives you and run them in your console.

It should be something like this:

```bash
$ git init
$ git commit -m "My entire dataviz"
$ git remote add origin git://github ...
$ git push origin -u master
```

If you’ve been git-ing locally without pushing, then you only need the ```git remote add``` and ```git push origin``` commands. This puts your code on Github. Great idea for anything you don’t want to lose if your computer craps out.

Every Github repository comes with an optional Github Pages setup. The easiest way for us to use it is with the ```gh-pages``` npm module.

Install it with this command:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

Add two lines to package.json:

```bash
// package.json
// Insert the line(s) between here...
"homepage": "https://<your username>.github.io/<your repo name>"
// ...and here.
"scripts": {
  "eject": "react-scripts eject",
  // Insert the line(s) between here...
  "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d build"
  // ...and here.
}
```

We’ve been ignoring the ```package.json``` file so far, but it’s a pretty important file. It specifies all of our project’s dependencies, meta data for npm, and scripts that we run locally. This is where ```npm start``` is defined, for instance.

We add a ```deploy``` script that runs ```build``` and a ```gh-pages``` deploy, and we specify a ```homepage``` URL. The URL tells our build script how to set up URLs for static files in ```index.html```.

Github Pages URLs follow the schema:

```
https://<your username>.github.io/<your repo name>
```

For instance, mine is:

```
https://swizec.github.io/react-d3-walkthrough-livecode
```

Yours will be different.

You can deploy with ```npm run deploy```. Make sure all changes are committed. We’ll do it together when we’re done setting up.
