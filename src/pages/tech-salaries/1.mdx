# A big example project - 176,113 tech salaries visualized

_This section is currently being re-recorded with hooks from the ground up. Feel free to read through this version, but I recommend waiting a couple days. Should be ready by Jun 18_

We're going to build this:

An interactive visualization dashboard app with a choropleth map and a
histogram comparing tech salaries to median household income in the area. Users
can filter by year, job title, or US state to get a better view.

It's going to be great.

At this point, I assume you've used `create-react-app` to set up your
environment. Check the
[getting started](/local-environment/1)
section if you haven't. I'm also assuming you've read the
[building blocks chapter](/building-blocks/1).
I'm still going to explain what we're doing, but knowing the basics helps.

I suggest you follow along, keep `npm start` running, and watch your
visualization change in real time as you code. It's rewarding as hell.

If you get stuck, you can use my
[react-d3-walkthrough-livecode](https://github.com/Swizec/react-d3-walkthrough-livecode)
to jump between steps. The
[commits](https://github.com/Swizec/react-d3-walkthrough-livecode/commits/master)
correspond to the code at the end of each step. Check out the first commit and
run `npm install` to skip the initial setup.

If you want to see how this project evolved over 22 months, check
[the original repo](https://github.com/Swizec/h1b-software-salaries). The
[modern-code](https://github.com/Swizec/h1b-software-salaries/tree/modern-code)
branch has the code you're about to build.
