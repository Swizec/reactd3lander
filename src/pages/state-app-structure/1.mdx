# Handling state in your React app

<Vimeo id={424598116} />

Before I can set you loose on the world, we should talk about managing state.
It's where most engineers shoot themselves in the foot.

You'll notice you shot yourself in the foot six months ago when all of a sudden
it becomes near impossible to build new features, add functionality, and know
what's going on with your app. If you find yourself spending a lot of time
confused about why your UI does something, you've shot yourself in the foot.

Don't worry tho, happens to everyone!

I shoot myself in the foot all the time. You can't predict how your app is
going to evolve. You can't know how technology is going to improve. Can't know
how your team will grow.

Best approach is to optimize for change.

Otherwise you might have to do a rewrite. Rewrites are bad. One of the most
infamous rewrite story is about
[The Rewrite that Killed Netscape](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html).
You might not even have heard of Netscape 😉

Let's save you from that.

## Basic architecture we'll use

<Vimeo id={424597983} />

![Unidirectional data flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/unidirectionalflow.png)

We're using a unidirectional data flow architecture with a single source of
truth. That means you always know what to expect. Think of your app as a giant
circle.

Data goes from your source of truth into your components. Events go from your
components into your source of truth. All in one direction

![The basic architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/architecture.png)

Our main App component holds state for your entire application. Anything that
multiple components should be aware of lives here. This state flows down the
hierarchy via props. Changes happen via callbacks, also passed down through
props.

Like this 👇

- The Main Component – `App` – holds the truth
- Truth flows down through props
- Child components react to user events
- They announce changes using callbacks
- The Main Component updates its truth
- Updates flow back down the chain
- UI updates through re-renders

This looks roundabout, but it's amazing. Far better than worrying about parts
of the UI growing out of sync with the rest of your app. I could talk your ear
off with debugging horror stories, but I'm nice, so I won't.

When a user clicks one of our controls, a `Toggle`, it invokes a callback. This
in turn invokes a callback on `ControlRow`, which invokes a callback on
`Controls`, which invokes a callback on `App`.

![Callback chain](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/architecture_callbacks.png)

With each hop, the nature of our callback changes. `Toggle` tells `ControlRow`
which entry was toggled, `ControlRow` tells `Controls` how to update the data
filter function, and `Controls` gives `App` a composite filter built from all
the controls. You'll see how that works in the next chapter.

All you have to remember right now is that callbacks evolve from passing
low-level information to high-level business logic. Starts with _"I was
clicked"_ ends with _"Update visualization filter"_

When the final callback is invoked, `App` updates its repository of truth –
`this.state` – and communicates the change back down the chain via props. No
additional wiring needed on your part. React's got you covered.

![Data flows down](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/architecture_dataflow.png)

You can think of it like calling functions with new arguments. Because the
functions – components – render the UI, your interface updates.

Because your components are well-made and rely on their props to render,
React's engine can optimize these changes. It compares the new and old
component trees and decides which components to re-render and which to leave
alone.

Functional programming for HTML! :sunglasses:

The functional programming concepts we're relying on are called
[referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency),
[idempotent functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), and
[functional purity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). I suggest
Googling them if you want to learn the theory behind it all.

## What about React Context? Redux? MobX?

You may have heard of React Context, Redux, MobX and other state handling
libraries. They're all great in different ways and the internet can't decide
which one is best. Everyone has their own little twist on the story.

And yet the basic principles are all the same:

1. Single source of truth
2. State flows down
3. Updates flow up

Where React Context, Redux, MobX and other libraries help, is how much work it
is to build this machinery and keep it running. How much flexibility you get
when moving components. Basically how easy it is to change your app later.

Remember the rewrite conundrum?

Our basic approach binds business structure to UI structure. Your state, your
props, your callbacks, they all follow the same hierarchy as your UI does.

Want to move the buy button? Great! You have to update the entire chain of
components leading from your state to that button.

Everything needs new callbacks and new props.

This is known as prop drilling and fast becomes super tedious. Rewiring your
whole app just to move a single button is no fun.

To solve this problem, React Context, Redux, MobX, etc. decouple your business
logic from your UI architecture. Take state out of the main component and move
it into its own object. Connect everything to that instead.

Now it doesn't matter where you move that button. It still triggers the same
function on the same state. Every other component that cares about that state
updates too.

Different libraries have different details for how that works, but they all
follow the same idea and solve the same problem.

We're sticking with the basic approach because it's easier to explain, works
without additional libraries, and is Good Enough™.

You can see an approach to using Redux in dataviz in the
[Animating with React, Redux, and D3 chapter](/redux-animation/1),
and we tackle MobX in the
[MobX chapter](/canvas-game/1).
