# Build scalable dataviz components with full integration {#full-feature-integration}

As useful as blackbox components are, we need something better if we want to
leverage React's rendering engine. The blackbox approach in particular
struggles with scale. The more charts and graphs and visualizations on your
screen, the slower it gets.

Someone once came to my workshop and said _"We used the blackbox approach and
it takes several seconds to re-render our dashboard on any change. I'm here to
learn how to do it better."_

In our full-feature integration, React does the rendering and D3 calculates the
props.

Our goal is to build controlled components that listen to their props and
reconcile that with D3's desire to use a lot of internal state.

There are two situations we can find ourselves in:

1. We know for a fact our component's props never change
2. We think props could change

It's easiest to show you with an example.

Let's build a scatterplot step by step. Take a random array of two-dimensional
data, render in a loop. Make magic.

Something like this 👇

You've already built the axes! Copy pasta time.
