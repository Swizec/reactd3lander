## Props might update

The story is a little different when our props might update. Since we're using
D3 objects to calculate SVG properties, we have to make sure those objects are
updated _before_ we render.

No problem in React 15: Update in `componentWillUpdate`. But since React 16.3
we've been told never to use that again. Causes problems for modern async
rendering.

The official recommended solution is that anything that used to go in
`componentWillUpdate`, can go in `componentDidUpdate`. But not so fast!

Updating D3 objects in `componentDidUpdate` would mean our visualization always
renders one update behind. Stale renders! :scream:

The new `getDerivedStateFromProps` to the rescue. Our integration follows a
3-step pattern:

- set up D3 objects in component state
- update D3 objects in `getDerivedStateFromProps`
- output SVG in `render()`

`getDerivedStateFromProps` is officially discouraged, and yet the best tool we
have to make sure D3 state is updated _before_ we render.

Because React calls `getDerivedStateFromProps` on every component render, not
just when our props actually change, you should avoid recalculating complex
things too often. Use memoization helpers, check for changes before updating,
stuff like that.

### An updateable scatterplot

Let's update our scatterplot so it can deal with resizing and updating data.

3 steps :point_down:

- add an interaction that resizes the scatterplot
- move scales to state
- update scales in `getDerivedStateFromProps`

You can see
[my final solution on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/ll9kp8or0l). I
recommend you follow along updating your existing code.

#### Resize scatterplot on click

To test our scatterplot's adaptability, we have to add an interaction: Resize
the scatterplot on click.

That change happens in `App.js`. Click on the `<svg>`, reduce width and height
by 30%.

Move sizing into App state and add an `onClick` handler.

```{.javascript caption="Sizing into state and click handler"}
// App.js
class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    width: 300,
    height: 300
  };

  onClick = () => {
    const { width, height } = this.state;
    this.setState({
      width: width * 0.7,
      height: height * 0.7
    });
  };

  render() {
    const { width, height } = this.state;
```

We changed our App component from a function to a class, added `state` with
default `width` and `height`, and an `onClick` method that reduces size by 30%.
The `render` method reads `width` and `height` from state.

Now gotta change rendering to listen to these values and fire the `onClick`
handler.

```{.javascript caption="Use state in rendering"}
// App.js

<svg width="800" height="800" onClick={this.onClick}>
  <Scatterplot
    x={50}
    y={50}
    width={width}
    height={height}
    data={data}
  />
</svg>
```

Similar rendering as before. We have an `<svg>` that contains a
`<Scatterplot>`. The svg fires `this.onClick` on click events and the
scatterplot uses our `width` and `height` values for its props.

If you try this code now, you should see a funny effect where axes move, but
the scatterplot doesn't resize.

![Axes move, scatterplot doesn't resize](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/not-resizing-scatterplot.png)

Peculiar isn't it? Try to guess why.

#### Move scales to state

The horizontal axis moves because it's render at `height` vertical coordinate.
Datapoints don't move because the scales that position them are calculated once
– on component mount.

First step to keeping scales up to date is to move them from component values
into state.

```{.javascript caption="Move scales into state"}
// Scatterplot.js
class Scatterplot extends React.Component {
  state = {
    xScale: d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain([0, 1])
      .range([0, this.props.width]),
    yScale: d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain([0, 1])
      .range([this.props.height, 0])
  };
```

Same scale definition code we had before. Linear scales, domain from 0 to 1,
using props for ranges. But now they're wrapped in a `state = {}` object and
it's `xScale: d3 ...` instead of `xScale = d3 ...`.

Our render function should use these as well. Small change:

```{.javascript caption="Render function uses state scales"}
// Scatterplot.js
  render() {
    const { x, y, data, height } = this.props,
      { yScale, xScale } = this.state;

    return (
      <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`}>
        {data.map(([x, y]) => <circle cx={xScale(:satisfied:} cy={yScale(y)} r="5" />)}
```

We use destructuring to take our scales from state, then use them when mapping
over our data.

Clicking on the SVG produces the same result as before, but we're almost there.
Just one more step.

#### Update scales in `getDerivedStateFromProps`

Last step is to update our scales' ranges in `getDerivedStateFromProps`. This
method runs every time React touches our component for any reason.

```{.javascript caption="Update scales"}
// Scatterplot.js
class Scatterplot extends React.PureComponent {
  // ..
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    const { yScale, xScale } = state;

    yScale.range([props.height, 0]);
    xScale.range([0, props.width]);

    return {
      ...state,
      yScale,
      xScale
    };
  }
```

Take scales from state, update ranges with new values, return new state. Nice
and easy.

Notice that `getDerivedStateFromProps` is a static method shared by all
instances of our Scatterplot component. You have no reference to a `this` and
have to calculate new state purely from the `props` and `state` passed into
your method.

It's a lot like a Redux reducer, if that helps you think about it. If you don't
know what Redux reducers are, don't worry. Just remember to return a new
version of component state.

Your Scatterplot should now update its size on every click.
