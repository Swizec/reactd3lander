# Render a Histogram of salaries

<Vimeo id={430409043} />

Knowing median salaries is great and all, but it doesn't tell you much about
what you can expect. You need to know the distribution to see if it's more
likely you'll get 140k or 70k.

That's what histograms are for. Give them a bunch of data, and they show its
distribution. We're going to build one like this:

![Basic histogram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/basic-histogram.png)

In the shortened dataset, 35% of tech salaries fall between \$60k and \$80k,
26% between \$80k and \$100k etc. Throwing a weighed dice with this
[random distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution),
you're far more likely to get 60k-80k than 120k-140k. It's a great way to gauge
situations.

It's where statistics like "More people die from vending machines than shark
attacks" come from. Which are you afraid of, vending machines or sharks? Stats
say your answer should be
[heart disease](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm). ðŸ˜‰

We'll start our histogram with some changes in `App.js`, make a `Histogram`
component using the
[full-feature approach](/building-blocks/3),
add an `Axis` using the
[blackbox useD3 approach](/building-blocks/5),
and finally add some styling.

## Step 1: Prep App.js

<Vimeo id={430409258} />

You know the drill, don't you? Import some stuff, add it to the `render()`
method in the `App` component.

```javascript
// src/App.js
import _ from "lodash"

// Insert the line(s) between here...
import "./style.css"
// ...and here.

import Preloader from "./components/Preloader"
import { loadAllData } from "./DataHandling"

import CountyMap from "./components/CountyMap"
// Insert the line(s) between here...
import Histogram from "./components/Histogram"
// ...and here.
```

We import `style.css` and the `Histogram` component. That's what I love about
Webpack - you can import CSS in JavaScript. We got the setup with
`create-react-app`.

There are competing schools of thought about styling React apps. Some say each
component should come with its own CSS files, some think it should be in large
per-app CSS files, many think CSS-in-JS is the way to go.

Personally I like to use CSS for general cross-component styling and
styled-components for more specific styles. We're using CSS in this project
because it works and means we don't have to learn yet another dependency.

After the imports, we can render our `Histogram` in the `App` component.

```javascript
// src/App.js
// ...
render() {
    // ...
    return (
        <div className="App container">
            <h1>Loaded {this.state.techSalaries.length} salaries</h1>
            <svg width="1100" height="500">
                <CountyMap usTopoJson={this.state.usTopoJson}
                           USstateNames={this.state.USstateNames}
                           values={countyValues}
                           x={0}
                           y={0}
                           width={500}
                           height={500}
                           zoom={zoom} />
                // Insert the line(s) between here...
                <Histogram bins={10}
                           width={500}
                           height={500}
                           x="500"
                           y="10"
                           data={filteredSalaries}
                           axisMargin={83}
                           bottomMargin={5}
                           value={d => d.base_salary} />
                // ...and here.
            </svg>
        </div>
    );
}
```

We render the `Histogram` component with a bunch of props. They specify the
dimensions we want, positioning, and pass data to the component. We're using
`filteredSalaries` even though we haven't set up any filtering yet. One less
line of code to change later ðŸ‘Œ

That's it. `App` is ready to render our `Histogram`.

You should now see an error about missing files. That's normal.

## Step 2: CSS changes

<Vimeo id={430409423} />

As mentioned, opinions vary on the best approach to styling React apps. Some
say stylesheets per component, some say styling inside JavaScript, others swear
by global app styling.

The truth is somewhere in between. Do what fits your project and your team.
We're using global stylesheets because it's the simplest.

Create a new file `src/style.css` and add these 29 lines:

```css
.histogram .bar rect {
  fill: steelblue;
  shape-rendering: crispEdges;
}

.histogram .bar text {
  fill: #fff;
  font: 12px sans-serif;
}

button {
  margin-right: 0.5em;
  margin-bottom: 0.3em !important;
}

.row {
  margin-top: 1em;
}

.mean text {
  font: 11px sans-serif;
  fill: grey;
}

.mean path {
  stroke-dasharray: 3;
  stroke: grey;
  stroke-width: 1px;
}
```

We won't go into details about the CSS here. Many better books have been
written about it.

In broad strokes:

- we're making `.histogram` rectangles â€“Â the bars â€“ blue
- labels white `12px` font
- `button`s and `.row`s have some spacing
- the `.mean` line is a dotted grey with gray `11px` text.

More CSS than we need for just the histogram, but we're already here so might
as well write it now.

Adding our CSS before building the Histogram means it's going to look beautiful
the first time around.

## Step 3: Histogram component

<Vimeo id={430409709} />

We're following the
[full-feature integration](/building-blocks/3)
approach for our Histogram component. React talks to the DOM, D3 calculates the
props.

We'll use two components:

1. `Histogram` makes the general layout, dealing with D3, and translating raw
   data into a histogram
2. `HistogramBar` draws a single bar and labels it

We create the `Histogram.js` file. Start with some imports, a default export,
and a stubbed out `Histogram` class.

```javascript
// src/components/Histogram.js
import React from "react"
import * as d3 from "d3"

const Histogram = ({
  bins,
  width,
  height,
  x,
  y,
  data,
  axisMargin,
  bottomMargin,
  value,
}) => {
  const histogram = d3.histogram()
  const widthScale = d3.scaleLinear()
  const yScale = d3.scaleLinear()

  return null
}
```

We import React and D3, and set up `Histogram` with 3 D3 elements

1. a histogram generator
2. a linear width scale
3. a linear y scale

### Rendering the histogram

<Vimeo id={430410657} />

```javascript
// src/components/Histogram.js
const histogram = d3.histogram().thresholds(bins).value(value)

const bars = histogram(data),
  counts = bars.map((d) => d.length)

const widthScale = d3
  .scaleLinear()
  .domain([d3.min(counts), d3.max(counts)])
  .range([0, width - axisMargin])

const yScale = d3
  .scaleLinear()
  .domain([0, d3.max(bars, (d) => d.x1)])
  .range([height - y - bottomMargin, 0])
```

First, we configure the `histogram` generator. `thresholds` specify how many
bins we want and `value` specifies the value accessor function. We get both
from props passed into the `Histogram` component.

In our case that makes 20 bins, and the value accessor returns each data
point's `base_salary`.

We feed the data prop into our histogram generator, and count how many values
are in each bin with a `.map` call. We need those to configure our scales.

If you print the result of `histogram()`, you'll see an array structure where
each entry holds metadata about the bin and the values it contains.

![console.log(this.histogram())](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/es6v2/histogram-data-screenshot.png)

Let's use this info to set up our scales.

`widthScale` has a range from the smallest (`d3.min`) bin to the largest
(`d3.max`), and a range of `0` to width less a margin. We'll use it to
calculate bar sizes.

`yScale` has a range from `0` to the largest `x1` coordinate we can find in a
bin. Bins go from `x0` to `x1`, which reflects the fact that most histograms
are horizontally oriented. Ours is vertical so that our labels are easier to
read. The range goes from `0` to the maximum height less a margin.

Now let's render this puppy.

### render

```javascript
// src/components/Histogram.js
<g className="bars">
  {bars.map((bar) => (
    <HistogramBar
      percent={(bar.length / data.length) * 100}
      x={axisMargin}
      y={yScale(bar.x1)}
      width={widthScale(bar.length)}
      height={yScale(bar.x0) - yScale(bar.x1)}
      key={`histogram-bar-${bar.x0}`}
    />
  ))}
</g>
```

We take everything we need out of `state` and `props` with destructuring, call
`histogram()` on our data to get a list of bars, and render.

Our render method returns a `<g>` grouping element transformed to the position
given in props and walks through the `bars` array, calling `makeBar` for each.
Later, we're going to add an `Axis` as well.

This is a great example of React's declarativeness. We have a bunch of stuff,
and all it takes to render is a loop. No worrying about how it renders, where
it goes, or anything like that. Walk through data, render, done.

Setting the `key` prop is important. React uses it to tell the bars apart and
only re-render those that change.

## Step 4: HistogramBar (sub)component

<Vimeo id={430410847} />

Before our histogram shows up, we need another component: `HistogramBar`. We
_could_ have shoved all of it in the `makeBar` function, but it makes sense to
keep separate. Better future flexibility.

You can write small components like this in the same file as their main
component. They're not reusable since they fit a specific use-case, and they're
small enough so your files don't get too crazy.

But in the interest of readability, let's make a `HistogramBar` file.

```javascript
// src/components/Histogram.js

const HistogramBar = ({ percent, x, y, width, height }) => {
  let translate = `translate(${x}, ${y})`,
    label = percent.toFixed(0) + "%"

  if (percent < 1) {
    label = percent.toFixed(2) + "%"
  }

  if (width < 20) {
    label = label.replace("%", "")
  }

  if (width < 10) {
    label = ""
  }

  return (
    <g transform={translate} className="bar">
      <rect width={width} height={height - 2} transform="translate(0, 1)" />
      <text textAnchor="end" x={width - 5} y={height / 2 + 3}>
        {label}
      </text>
    </g>
  )
}
```

We start by deciding how much precision to put in the label. Makes the smaller bars easier to read :)

Then we render a `rect`angle for the bar and add a `text` element for the label. Positioning based on size.

You should now see a histogram.

![Histogram without axis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/histogram-without-axis.png)

## Step 5: Axis

<Vimeo id={430411631} />

Our histogram is pretty, but it needs an axis to be useful. You've already
learned how to implement an axis when we talked about
[blackbox integration](/building-blocks/1).
We're going to use the same approach and copy those concepts into the real
project.

### Axis component

We can use the `useD3` hook from my `d3blackbox` library to make this work quickly.

```javascript
// src/components/Axis.js

import React from "react"
import { useD3 } from "d3blackbox"

import * as d3 from "d3"

const Axis = ({ x, y, scale, type = "Bottom" }) => {
  const gRef = useD3((anchor) => {
    const axis = d3[`axis${type}`](scale)

    d3.select(anchor).call(axis)
  })

  return <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`} ref={gRef} />
}

export default Axis
```

We use D3's axis generator based on the `type` prop and pass in a `scale`. To render, we `select` the anchor element and `call` the axis generator on it.

### Add Axis to Histogram

To render our new `Axis`, we add it to the `Histogram` component. It's a two
step process:

1. Import `Axis` component
2. Render it

```javascript
// src/components/Histogram/Histogram.js
import React, { Component } from "react"
import * as d3 from "d3"

// Insert the line(s) between here...
import Axis from "./Axis"
// ...and here.

// ...
const Histogram = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <g className="histogram" transform={translate}>
      <g className="bars">{bars.map(this.makeBar)}</g>
      // Insert the line(s) between here...
      <Axis x={axisMargin - 3} y={0} data={bars} scale={yScale} />
      // ...and here.
    </g>
  )
}
```

We import our `Axis` and add it to the `render` method with some props. It
takes an `x` and `y` coordinate, the `data`, and a `scale`.

An axis appears.
