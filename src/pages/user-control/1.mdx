# Add user controls for data slicing and dicing

<Vimeo id={432211014} />

Now comes the fun part. All that extra effort we put into making our components
aware of filtering, and it all comes down to this: User controls.

Here's what we're building:

![User controlled filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/es6v2/controls.png)

It's a set of filters for users to slice and dice our visualization. The
shortened dataset gives you 2 years, 12 job titles, and 50 US states. You'll
get 5+ years and many more job titles with the full dataset.

We're using the
[architecture we discussed](https://swizec1.teachable.com/courses/react-for-data-visualization/lectures/6887770#basic-architecture)
earlier to make it work. Clicking buttons updates a filter function and
communicates it all the way up to the `App` component. `App` then uses it to
update `this.state.filteredSalaries`, which triggers a re-render and updates
our dataviz.

![Architecture sketch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/architecture_callbacks.png)

We're building controls in 4 steps, top to bottom:

1. Update `App.js` with filtering and a `<Controls>` render
2. Build a `Controls` component, which builds the filter based on inputs
3. Build a `ControlRow` component, which handles a row of buttons
4. Build a `Toggle` component, which is a button

We'll go through the files linearly. That makes them easier for me to explain
and easier for you to understand, but that also means there's going to be a
long period where all you're seeing is an error like this:

![Controls error during coding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/es6v2/controls-error.png)

If you want to see what's up during this process, remove an import or two and
maybe a thing from render. For instance, it's complaining about `ControlRow` in
this screenshot. Remove the `ControlRow` import on top and delete
`<ControlRow ... />` from render. The error goes away, and you see what you're
doing.

## Step 1: Update App.js

<Vimeo id={432211494} />

All right, you know the drill. Add imports, tweak some things, add to render.
We have to import `Controls`, set up filtering, update the map's `zoom` prop,
and render a white rectangle and `Controls`.

The white rectangle makes it so the zoomed-in map doesn't cover up the
histogram. I'll explain when we get there.

```javascript
// src/App.js
import MedianLine from "./components/MedianLine"

// Insert the line(s) between here...
import Controls from "./components/Controls"
// ...and here.

class App extends React.Component {
    // Insert the line(s) between here...
    const [salariesFilter, setSalariesFilter] = useState(() => () => true);
    // ...and here.
    const [filteredBy, setFilteredBy] = useState({
        USstate: "*",
        year: "*",
        jobTitle: "*",
    });


  // ...

  // Insert the line(s) between here...
  function updateDataFilter(filter, filteredBy) {
        setFilteredBy(filteredBy);
        setSalariesFilter(() => filter);
    }
  // ...and here.

  render() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

We import the `Controls` component and add a default `salariesFilter` function
to `this.state`. The `updateDataFilter` method passes the filter function and
`filteredBy` dictionary from arguments to App state. We'll use it as a callback
in `Controls`.

The rest of filtering setup happens in the render method.

```javascript
// src/App.js
function App() {
    // ...

        // ...
        // Delete the line(s) between here...
        const filteredSalaries = techSalaries
        // ...and here.
        // Insert the line(s) between here...
        const filteredSalaries = techSalaries
                                     .filter(salariesFilter)
        // ...and here.

        // ...

        let zoom = null,
            medianHousehold = // ...
        // Insert the line(s) between here...
        if (filteredBy.USstate !== "*") {
            zoom = filteredBy.USstate;
            medianHousehold = d3.mean(
                medianIncomesByUSState[zoom],
                (d) => d.medianIncome
            );
        }
        // ...and here.

        // ...
    }
}
```

We add a `.filter` call to `filteredSalaries`, which uses our `salariesFilter`
method to throw out anything that doesn't fit. Then we set up `zoom`, if a US
state was selected.

We built the `CountyMap` component to focus on a given US state. Finding the
centroid of a polygon, re-centering the map, and increasing the sizing factor.
It creates a nice zoom effect.

![Zoom effect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/es6v2/zoom-effect.png)

And here's the downside of this approach. SVG doesn't know about element
boundaries. It just renders stuff.

![Zoom without white rectangle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/es6v2/zoom-without-rectangle.png)

See, it goes under the histogram. Let's fix that and add the `Controls` render
while we're at it.

```javascript
// src/App.js
function App() {
    // ...

        // ...

        return (
            <div //...>
                <svg //...>
                    <CountyMap //... />

                    // Insert the line(s) between here...
                    <rect x="500" y="0"
                          width="600"
                          height="500"
                          style={{fill: 'white'}} />
                    // ...and here.

                    <Histogram //... />
                    <MedianLine //.. />
                </svg>

                // Insert the line(s) between here...
                <Controls data={techSalaries}
                          updateDataFilter={updateDataFilter} />
                // ...and here.
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

Rectangle, `500` to the right, `0` from top, `600` wide and `500` tall, with a
white background. Gives the histogram an opaque background, so it doesn't
matter what the map is doing.

We render the `Controls` component just after `</svg>` because it's not an SVG
component – it uses normal HTML. Unlike other components, it needs our entire
dataset as `data`. We use the `updateDataFilter` prop to say which callback
function it should call when a new filter is ready.

If this seems roundabout ... I've seen worse. The callbacks approach makes our
app easier to componentize and keeps the code relatively unmessy. Imagine
putting everything we've done so far in `App`! :satisfied:

## Step 2: Build Controls component

<Vimeo id={432212029} />

The `Controls` component builds our filter function and `filteredBy` dictionary
based on user choices.

`Controls` renders 3 rows of buttons and builds filtering out of the choice
made on each row. That makes `Controls` kind of repetitive, but that's okay.

To keep this book shorter, we're going to build everything for a `year` filter
first. Then I'll explain how to add `USstate` and `jobTitle` filters on a
higher level. Once you have one working, the rest follows that same pattern.

Make a `Controls` directory in `src/components/` and let's begin. The main
`Controls` component goes in your `index.js` file.

### Stub Controls

```javascript
// src/components/Controls.js
import React from "react"

import ControlRow from "./ControlRow"

const Controls = ({ data, updateDataFilter }) => {
  const [filteredBy, setFilteredBy] = useState({
    year: "*",
  })
  const [filterFunctions, setFilter] = useState({
    year: () => true,
  })

  const updateYearFilter = (year, reset) => {}
}

export default Controls
```

We start with some imports and a `Controls` class-based component. Inside, we
define default `state` with an always-true `yearFilter` and an asterisk for
`year`.

We also need an `updateYearFilter` function, which we'll use to update the
filter, a `reportUpdateUpTheChain` function, and a `render` method. We're using
`reportUpdateUpTheChain` to bubble updates to our parent component. It's a
simpler alternative to using React Context or a state management library.

### Filter logic

<Vimeo id={432212799} />

```javascript
// src/components/Controls.js
const Controls = (...) => {
  // ...
  const updateYearFilter = (year, reset) => {
    let yearFilter = (d) => d.submit_date.getFullYear() === year

    if (reset || !year) {
      yearFilter = () => true
      year = "*"
    }

    setFilteredBy((filteredBy) => {
      return { ...filteredBy, year }
    })
    setFilter((filterFunctions) => {
      return { ...filterFunctions, year: yearFilter }
    })
  }
}
```

`updateYearFilter` is a callback we pass into `ControlRow`. When a user picks a
year, their action triggers this function.

When that happens, we create a new partial filter function. The `App` component
uses it inside a `.filter` call like you saw earlier. We have to return `true`
for elements we want to keep and `false` for elements we don't.

Comparing `submit_date.getFullYear()` with `year` achieves that.

The `reset` argument lets us reset filters back to defaults. Enables users to
unselect options.

When we have the `year` and `filter`, we update component state with
`this.setState`. This triggers a re-render and calls `reportUpdateUpTheChain`
afterwards. Great use-case for the little known setState callback 😃

`reportUpdateUpTheChain` then calls `this.props.updateDataFilter`, which is a
callback method on `App`. We defined it earlier – it needs a new filter method
and a `filteredBy` dictionary.

```
// src/components/Controls.js
const Controls = ( ... ) => {
    // ...
    function reportUpdateUpTheChain() {
        window.location.hash = [
            filteredBy.year
        ].join("-");

        const filter = (d) =>
            filterFunctions.year(d)

        updateDataFilter(filter, filteredBy);
    }
}
```

Building the filter method looks tricky because we're composing multiple
functions. The new arrow function takes a dictionary of filters as an argument
and returns a new function that `&&`s them all. We invoke it immediately with
`this.state` as the argument.

It looks silly when there's just one filter, but I promise it makes sense.

### Render

Great, we have the filter logic. Let's render those rows of controls we've been
talking about.

```javascript
// src/components/Controls/index.js
const Controls = (...) => {
  // ...
    const years = new Set(data.map((d) => d.submit_date.getFullYear()));

    return (
      <div>
         <ControlRow
                data={data}
                toggleNames={Array.from(years.values())}
                picked={filteredBy.year}
                updateDataFilter={updateYearFilter}
            />
      </div>
    )

}
```

Once more, this is generalized code used for a single example: the `year`
filter.

We build a `Set` of distinct years in our dataset, then render a `ControlRow`
using props to give it our `data`, a set of `toggleNames`, a callback to update
the filter, and which entry is `picked` right now. Also known as the controlled
component pattern, it enables us to maintain the data-flows-down,
events-bubble-up architecture.

If you don't know about `Set`s, they're an ES6 data structure that ensures
every entry is unique. Just like a mathematical set. They're pretty fast.

## Step 3: Build ControlRow component

<Vimeo id={432213165} />

Let's build the `ControlRow` component. It renders a row of controls and
ensures only one at a time is selected.

We'll start with a stub and go from there.

```javascript
// src/components/Controls.js
import React from "react"

const ControlRow = ({
  data,
  toggleNames,
  picked,
  updateDataFilter,
  capitalize,
}) => {
  function makePick(picked, newState) {
    updateDataFilter(picked, !newState)
  }
}
```

`makePick` calls the data filter update and passes in the new value and whether
we want to unselect. Pretty simple right?

```javascript
// src/components/Controls.js
const ControlRow = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <div className="row">
      <div className="col-md-12">
        {toggleNames.map((name) => (
          <Toggle
            label={capitalize ? name.toUpperCase() : name}
            name={name}
            key={name}
            value={picked === name}
            onClick={makePick}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In render, we set up two `div`s with Bootstrap classes. The first is a `row`,
and the second is a full-width column. I tried using a column for each button,
but it was annoying to manage and used too much space.

Inside the divs, we map over all toggles and use the `<Toggle>` component to render each of them. The label is a prettier version of the name, which
also serves as a key in our `toggleValues` dictionary. It's going to be the
`picked` attribute in `makePick`.

Your browser should continue showing an error, but it should change to talking
about the `Toggle` component instead of `ControlRow`.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/es6v2/toggle-error.png)

Let's build it.

## Step 5: Add US state and Job Title filters

<Vimeo id={432214569} />

With all that done, we can add two more filters: US states and job titles. Our
`App` component is already set up to use them, so we just have to add them to
the `Controls` component.

We'll start with the `render` method, then handle the parts I said earlier
would look repetitive.

```javascript
// src/components/Controls.js
const Controls = () => {
  // ...

    const years = new Set(data.map((d) => d.submit_date.getFullYear())),
      // Insert the line(s) between here...
      jobTitles = new Set(data.map((d) => d.clean_job_title)),
      USstates = new Set(data.map((d) => d.USstate))
    // ...and here.

    return (
      <div>
        <ControlRow
          data={data}
          toggleNames={Array.from(years.values())}
          picked={this.state.year}
          updateDataFilter={this.updateYearFilter}
        />
        // Insert the line(s) between here...
        <ControlRow
          data={data}
          toggleNames={Array.from(jobTitles.values())}
          picked={this.state.jobTitle}
          updateDataFilter={this.updateJobTitleFilter}
        />
        <ControlRow
          data={data}
          toggleNames={Array.from(USstates.values())}
          picked={this.state.USstate}
          updateDataFilter={this.updateUSstateFilter}
          capitalize="true"
        />
        // ...and here.
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Ok, this part is plenty repetitive, too.

We created new sets for `jobTitles` and `USstates`, then rendered two more
`ControlRow` elements with appropriate attributes. They get `toggleNames` for
building the buttons, `picked` to know which is active, an `updateDataFilter`
callback, and we tell US states to render capitalized.

The implementations of those `updateDataFilter` callbacks follow the same
pattern as `updateYearFilter`.

```javascript
// src/components/Controls.js

const Controls = () => {
  const [filteredBy, setFilteredBy] = useState({
    year: "*",
    USstate: "*",
    jobTitle: "*",
  })
  const [filterFunctions, setFilter] = useState({
    year: () => true,
    USstate: () => true,
    jobTitle: () => true,
  })

  const updateJobTitleFilter = (jobTitle, reset) => {
    let jobTitleFilter = (d) => d.clean_job_title === jobTitle

    if (reset || !jobTitle) {
      jobTitleFilter = () => true
      jobTitle = "*"
    }

    setFilteredBy((filteredBy) => {
      return { ...filteredBy, jobTitle }
    })
    setFilter((filterFunctions) => {
      return { ...filterFunctions, jobTitle: jobTitleFilter }
    })

    reportUpdateUpTheChain()
  }

  const updateUSstateFilter = (USstate, reset) => {
    let USstateFilter = (d) => d.clean_job_title === USstate

    if (reset || !USstate) {
      USstateFilter = () => true
      USstate = "*"
    }

    setFilteredBy((filteredBy) => {
      return { ...filteredBy, USstate }
    })
    setFilter((filterFunctions) => {
      return { ...filterFunctions, USstate: USstateFilter }
    })

    reportUpdateUpTheChain()
  }

  // ..
}

export default Controls
```

Yes, they're basically the same as `updateYearFilter`. The only difference is a
changed `filter` function and using different keys when setting state.

Why separate functions then? No need to get fancy. It would've made the code
harder to read.

Our last step is to add these new keys to the `reportUpdateUpTheChain`
function.

```javascript
// src/components/Controls/index.js

const Controls = () => {
  function reportUpdateUpTheChain() {
    window.location.hash = [
      filteredBy.year,
      filteredBy.USstate,
      filteredBy.jobTitle,
    ].join("-")

    const filter = (d) =>
      filterFunctions.year(d) &&
      filterFunctions.USstate(d) &&
      filterFunctions.jobTitle(d)

    updateDataFilter(filter, filteredBy)
  }
}
```

We add them to the filter condition with `&&` and expand the `filteredBy`
argument.

Two more rows of filters show up.

![All the filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/es6v2/all-filters.png)

👏

## Stale state is stale 🤨

<Vimeo id={432215286} />

A funny thing happened. We were calling `reportUpdateUpTheChain` which relies on local state in the component.

But that state doesn't update right away. And the state hook provides no callback like the old `this.setState` used to.

`reportUpdateUpTheChain` is a side-effect! We have to use `useEffect`.

```javascript
// src/components/Controls.js

const Controls = ({ data, updateDataFilter }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    reportUpdateUpTheChain()
  }, [filteredBy, filterFunctions])
}
```

You should now have a working data visualization dashboard with user controls. It struggles on certain clicks because of the shortened dataset.

If that didn't work, consult the [diff on GitHub](https://github.com/Swizec/reactdataviz-project/commit/eb3533b04e91977ae26ae8e983b93a823d328f87)
