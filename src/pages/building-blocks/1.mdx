# Quickly integrate any D3 code in your React project with Blackbox Components

_This section teaches you the mental models of blackbox components and builds them up through class-based components. If you don't care about the details, you can jump ahead to using them with [React Hooks](/building-blocks/5)._

Blackbox components are the quickest way to integrate D3 and React. You can
think of them as wrappers around D3 visualizations.

With the blackbox approach, you can take any D3 example from the internets or
your brain, wrap it in a React component, and it Just Worksâ„¢. This is great
when you're in a hurry, but comes with a big caveat: You're letting D3 control
some of the DOM.

D3 controlling the DOM is _okay_, but it means React can't help you there.
That's why it's called a Blackbox â€“Â React can't see inside.

No render engine, no tree diffing, no dev tools to inspect what's going. Just a
blob of DOM elements.

Okay for small components or when you're prototyping, but I've had people come
to my workshops and say _"We built our whole app with the blackbox approach. It
takes a few seconds to re-render when you click something. Please help"_

ðŸ¤”

Here's how it works:

- React renders an anchor element
- D3 hijacks it and puts stuff in

You manually re-render on props and state changes. Throwing away and rebuilding
the entire DOM subtree on each render. With complex visualizations this becomes
a huge hit on performance.

Use this technique sparingly.

## A quick blackbox example - a D3 axis

<Vimeo id={424606250} />

Let's build an axis component. Axes are the perfect use-case for blackbox
components. D3 comes with an axis generator bundled inside, and they're
difficult to build from scratch.

They don't _look_ difficult, but there are many tiny details you have to get
_just right_.

D3's axis generator takes a scale and some configuration to render an axis for
us. The code looks like this:

```javascript
const scale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 10]).range([0, 200])
const axis = d3.axisBottom(scale)

d3.select("svg").append("g").attr("transform", "translate(10, 30)").call(axis)
```

You can [try it out on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/v6ovkow8q3).

If this code doesn't make any sense, don't worry. There's a bunch of D3 to
learn, and I'll help you out. If it's obvious, you're a pro! This book will be
much quicker to read.

We start with a linear scale that has a domain `[0, 10]` and a range
`[0, 200]`. Scales are like mathematical functions that map a domain to a
range. In this case, calling `scale(0)` returns `0`, `scale(5)` returns `100`,
`scale(10)` returns `200`. Just like a linear function from math class â€“Â y =
kx + n.

We create an axis generator with `axisBottom`, which takes a `scale` and
creates a `bottom` oriented axis â€“ numbers below the line. You can also change
settings for the number of ticks, their sizing, spacing, and so on.

Equipped with an `axis` generator, we `select` the `svg` element, append a
grouping element, use a `transform` attribute to move it `10`px to the right
and `30`px down, and invoke the generator with `.call()`.

It creates a small axis:

Play around with it on [Codesandbox](https://codepen.io/swizec/pen/YGoYBM).
Change the scale type, play with axis orientation. Use `.ticks` on the axis to
change how many show up. Have some fun ðŸ˜ƒ

## A quick blackbox example - a React+D3 axis

<Vimeo id={424605514} />

Now let's say we want to use that same axis code but as a React component. The
simplest way is to use a blackbox component approach like this:

```javascript
class Axis extends Component {
  gRef = React.createRef()

  componentDidMount() {
    this.d3render()
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    this.d3render()
  }

  d3render() {
    const scale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 10]).range([0, 200])
    const axis = d3.axisBottom(scale)

    d3.select(this.gRef).call(axis)
  }

  render() {
    return <g transform="translate(10, 30)" ref={this.gRef} />
  }
}
```

So much code! Worth it for the other benefits of using React in your dataviz.
You'll see ðŸ˜ƒ

We created an `Axis` component that extends React's base `Component` class. We
can't use functional components because we need lifecycle hooks.

Our component has a `render` method. It returns a grouping element (`g`) moved
10px to the right and 30px down using the `transform` attribute. Same as
before.

A React ref saved in `this.gRef` and passed into our `<g>` element with `ref`
lets us talk to the DOM node directly. We need this to hand over rendering
control to D3.

The `d3render` method looks familiar. It's the same code we used in the vanilla
D3 example. Scale, axis, select, call. Only difference is that instead of
selecting `svg` and appending a `g` element, we select the `g` element rendered
by React and use that.

We use `componentDidUpdate` and `componentDidMount` to keep our render up to
date. Ensures that our axis re-renders every time React's engine decides to
render our component.

That wasn't so bad, was it?

You can make the axis more useful by getting positioning, scale, and
orientation from props. We'll do that in our big project.

### Practical exercise

Try implementing those as an exercise. Make the axis more reusable with some
carefully placed props.

Here's my solution, if you get stuck ðŸ‘‰

## A D3 blackbox higher order component â€“ HOC

<Vimeo id={424605202} />

After that example you might think this is hella tedious to implement every
time. You'd be right!

Good thing you can abstract it all away with a higher order component â€“Â a HOC.
Now this is something I should open source (just do it already), but I want to
show you how it works so you can learn about the HOC pattern.

Higher order components are great when you see multiple React components
sharing similar code. In our case, that shared code is:

- rendering an anchor element
- calling D3's render on updates

With a HOC, we can abstract that away into a sort of [object factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern). It's an old concept making a comeback now that JavaScript has classes.

Think of our HOC as a function that takes some params and creates a class â€“ a
React component. Another way to think about HOCs is that they're React
components wrapping other React components and a function that makes it easy.

A HOC for D3 blackbox integration, called `D3blackbox`, looks like like this:

```javascript
function D3blackbox(D3render) {
  return class Blackbox extends React.Component {
    anchor = React.createRef()

    componentDidMount() {
      D3render.call(this)
    }
    componentDidUpdate() {
      D3render.call(this)
    }

    render() {
      const { x, y } = this.props
      return <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`} ref={this.anchor} />
    }
  }
}
```

You'll recognize most of that code from earlier.

We have `componentDidMount` and`componentDidUpdate` lifecycle hooks that call
`D3render` on component updates. `render` renders a grouping element as an
anchor with a ref so D3 can use it to render stuff into.

Because `D3render` is no longer a part of our component, we have to use `.call`
to give it the scope we want: this class, or rather `this` instance of the
`Blackbox` class.

We've also made some changes that make `render` more flexible. Instead of
hardcoding the `translate()` transformation, we take `x` and `y` props.
`{ x, y } = this.props` takes `x` and `y` out of `this.props` using object
decomposition, and we used ES6 string templates for the `transform` attribute.

Consult the [ES6 cheatsheet](https://es6cheatsheet.com/) for details on the
syntax.

Using our new `D3blackbox` HOC to make an axis looks like this:

```javascript
const Axis = D3blackbox(function () {
  const scale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 10]).range([0, 200])
  const axis = d3.axisBottom(scale)

  d3.select(this.anchor).call(axis)
})
```

You know this code! We copy pasted our axis rendering code from before, wrapped
it in a function, and passed it into `D3blackbox`. Now it's a React component.
