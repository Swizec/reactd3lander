### Part 2: Building the physics

Our whole physics engine fits into a single MobX store. It contains the
collision detection, marble movement calculations, and drives the game loop
itself.

The general approach goes like this:

1. Have an observable array of marbles
2. Run a `simulationStep` on each `requestAnimationFrame` using `d3.timer`
3. Change marble positions and speed
4. MobX observables and observers trigger re-renders of marbles that move

The
[whole Physics store](https://github.com/Swizec/declarative-canvas-react-konva/blob/master/src/logic/Physics.js)
is some 120 lines of code. We'll go slow. Here's the skeleton:

```javascript
// src/logic/Physics.js

class Physics {
    @observable MarbleR = 25;
    @observable width = 800;
    @observable height = 600;
    @observable marbles = [];
    timer = null;

    @computed get initialPositions() {

    }

    @action startGameLoop() {

    }

    @action simulationStep() {

    }

    @action shoot({ x, y, vx, vy }, i) {

    }
}
```

We have four observable properties, a `timer`, a `@computed` property for
initial positions, and 3 actions. `startGameLoop` starts our game,
`simulationStep` holds the main logic, and `shoot` shoots a particular marble.

Let's walk through.

#### initialPositions

```javascript
// src/logic/Physics.js
class Physics {
    // ..
    @computed get initialPositions() {
        const { width, height, MarbleR } = this,
              center = width/2;

        const lines = 4,
              maxY = 200;

        let marbles = range(lines, 0, -1).map(y => {
            if (y === lines) return [{ x: center, y: maxY,
                                       vx: 0, vy: 0, r: this.MarbleR}];

            const left = center - y*(MarbleR+5),
                  right = center + y*(MarbleR+5);

            return range(left, right, MarbleR*2+5).map(x => ({
                x: x,
                y: maxY-y*(MarbleR*2+5),
                vx: 0,
                vy: 0,
                r: this.MarbleR
            }));
        }).reduce((acc, pos) => acc.concat(pos), []);

        marbles = [].concat(marbles, {
            x: width/2,
            y: height-150,
            vx: 0,
            vy: 0,
            r: this.MarbleR
        });

        marbles.forEach((m, i) => marbles[i].id = i);

        return marbles;
    }
    // ..
}
```

Believe it or not, this is like one of those _"Arrange things in a triangle"_
puzzles you'd see in an old Learn How To Program book. Or a whiteboard
interview.

It took me 3 hours to build. Easy to get wrong, fiddly to implement.

We start with a `range` of numbers. From `lines` to `0` in descending order. We
iterate through this list of rows and change each into a list of marbles.

4 marbles in the first row, 3 in the next, all the way down to 1 in last row.

For each row, we calculate how much space we have on the `left` and `right` of
the center and make a `range` of horizontal positions from `left` to `right`
with a step of "1 marble size". Using these positions and the known row, we
create marbles as needed.

We use a `.reduce` to flatten nested arrays and add the last marble. That's a
corner case I couldn't solve elegantly, but I'm sure it's possible.

In the end, we add an `id` to each marble. We're using index as the id, that's
true, but that still ensures we use consistent values throughout our app.
Positions in the array may change.

#### shoot and startGameLoop

```javascript
// src/logic/Physics.js
class Physics {
    // ...

    @action startGameLoop() {
        this.marbles = this.initialPositions;

        this.timer = timer(() => this.simulationStep());
    }

    // ...

    @action shoot({ x, y, vx, vy }, i) {
        const maxSpeed = 20;

        this.marbles[i].x = x;
        this.marbles[i].y = y;
        this.marbles[i].vx = vx < maxSpeed ? vx : maxSpeed;
        this.marbles[i].vy = vy < maxSpeed ? vy : maxSpeed;
    }
}
```

`shoot` and `startGameLoop` are the simplest functions in our physics engine.
`startGameLoop` gets the initial `marbles` array and starts a D3 timer. `shoot`
updates a specific marble's coordinates and speed vector.
