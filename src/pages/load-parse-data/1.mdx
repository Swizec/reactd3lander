# Asynchronously load data

<Vimeo id={429666375} />

Great! We have a preloader. Time to load some data.

We'll use D3's built-in data loading methods and tie their promises into
React's component lifecycle. You could talk to a REST API in the same way.
Neither D3 nor React care what the datasource is.

First, you need some data.

Our dataset comes from a few sources. Tech salaries are from
[h1bdata.info](https://h1bdata.info), median household incomes come from the US
census data, and I got US geo map info from Mike Bostock's github repositories.
Some elbow grease and python scripts tied them all together.

You can read about the scraping on my blog
[here](https://swizec.com/blog/place-names-county-names-geonames/swizec/7083),
[here](https://swizec.com/blog/facts-us-household-income/swizec/7075), and
[here](https://swizec.com/blog/livecoding-24-choropleth-react-js/swizec/7078).
But it's not the subject of this course.

## Step 0: Get the data

<Vimeo id={429666495} />

Download the data files from
[my walkthrough repository on Github](https://github.com/Swizec/reactdataviz-project/tree/master/public/data).
Put them in your `public/data` directory.

## Step 1: Prep App.js

<Vimeo id={429666967} />

Let's set up our `App` component first. That way you'll see results as soon
data loading starts to work.

Start by importing our data loading method - `loadAllData` - and both D3 and
Lodash. We'll need them later.

```javascript
// src/App.js
import React from "react"
// Insert the line(s) between here...
import * as d3 from "d3"
import _ from "lodash"
// ...and here.

import Preloader from "./components/Preloader"
// Insert the line(s) between here...
import { loadAllData } from "./DataHandling"
// ...and here.
```

You already know about default imports. Importing with `{}` is how we import
named exports. That lets us get multiple things from the same file. You'll see
the export side in Step 2.

Don't worry about the missing `DataHandling` file. It's coming soon.

```javascript
// src/App.js
function App() {
    const [techSalaries, setTechSalaries] = useState([]);

    // Insert the line(s) between here...
    const [medianIncomes, setMedianIncomes] = useState([]);
    const [countyNames, setCountyNames] = useState([]);

    async function loadData() {
        const data = await loadAllData();

        const { techSalaries, medianIncomes, countyNames } = data;

        setTechSalaries(techSalaries);
        setMedianIncomes(medianIncomes);
        setCountyNames(countyNames);
    }

    useEffect(() => {
        loadData();
    }, []);
    // ...and here.
```

We initiate data loading inside the `useEffect` hook. It
fires when React first mounts our component into the DOM.

I like to tie data loading to component mounts because it means you aren't
making requests you'll never use. In a bigger app, you'd use Redux, MobX, or
similar to decouple loading from rendering. Many reasons why.

To load our data, we call the `loadAllData` function, then use state setters
in the callback. This updates `App`'s state and triggers a re-render, which
updates our entire visualization via props.

We also add two more pieces of state: `countyNames`, and
`medianIncomes`. Defining what's in your component state in advance makes your
code easier to read. People, including you, know what to expect.

Let's change rendering to show a message when our data finishes
loading.

```javascript
// src/App.js
if (techSalaries.length < 1) {
  return <Preloader />
} else {
  return (
    <div className="App container">
      <h1>Loaded {techSalaries.length} salaries</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We added a `container` class to the main `<div>` and an `<h1>` tag that shows
how many datapoints there are. You can use any valid JavaScript in curly braces
`{}` and JSX will evaluate it. By convention we only use that ability to
calculate display values.

You should now get an error overlay.

![DataHandling.js not found error overlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/es6v2/datahandling-error.png)

These nice error overlays come with `create-react-app` and make your code
easier to debug. No hunting around in the terminal to see compilation errors.

Let's build that file and fill it with our data loading logic.

## Step 2: Prep data parsing functions

<Vimeo id={429667128} />

We're putting data loading logic in a separate file from `App.js` because it's
a bunch of functions that work together and don't have much to do with the
`App` component itself.

We start with two imports and four data parsing functions:

- `cleanIncome`, which parses each row of household income data
- `dateParse`, which we use for parsing dates
- `cleanSalary`, which parses each row of salary data
- `cleanUSStateName`, which parses US state names

```javascript
// src/DataHandling.js
import * as d3 from "d3"
import _ from "lodash"

const cleanIncome = (d) => ({
  countyName: d["Name"],
  USstate: d["State"],
  medianIncome: Number(d["Median Household Income"]),
  lowerBound: Number(d["90% CI Lower Bound"]),
  upperBound: Number(d["90% CI Upper Bound"]),
})

const dateParse = d3.timeParse("%m/%d/%Y")

const cleanSalary = (d) => {
  if (!d["base salary"] || Number(d["base salary"]) > 300000) {
    return null
  }

  return {
    employer: d.employer,
    submit_date: dateParse(d["submit date"]),
    start_date: dateParse(d["start date"]),
    case_status: d["case status"],
    job_title: d["job title"],
    clean_job_title: d["job title"],
    base_salary: Number(d["base salary"]),
    city: d["city"],
    USstate: d["state"],
    county: d["county"],
    countyID: d["countyID"],
  }
}

const cleanUSStateName = (d) => ({
  code: d.code,
  id: Number(d.id),
  name: d.name,
})

const cleanCounty = (d) => ({
  id: Number(d.id),
  name: d.name,
})
```

You'll see those `d3` and `lodash` imports a lot.

Our data parsing functions all follow the same approach: Take a row of data as
`d`, return a dictionary with nicer key names, cast any numbers or dates into
appropriate formats. They all start as strings.

Doing all this parsing now, keeps the rest of our codebase clean. Handling data
is always messy. You want to contain that mess as much as possible.

## Step 3: Load the datasets

<Vimeo id={429667304} />

Now we can use D3 to load our data with fetch requests.

```javascript
// src/DataHandling.js
export const loadAllData = async () => {
  const datasets = await Promise.all([
    d3.json("data/us.json"),
    d3.csv("data/us-county-names-normalized.csv", cleanCounty),
    d3.csv("data/county-median-incomes.csv", cleanIncome),
    d3.csv("data/h1bs-2012-2016-shortened.csv", cleanSalary),
    d3.tsv("data/us-state-names.tsv", cleanUSStateName),
  ]) //.then(([us, countyNames, medianIncomes, techSalaries, USstateNames]) => {})
}
```

In version 5, D3 updated its data loading methods to use promises instead of
callbacks. You can load a single file using
`d3.csv("filename").then(data => ....`. The promise resolves with your data, or
throws an error.

Each `d3.csv` call makes a fetch request, parses the fetched CSV file into an
array of JavaScript dictionaries, and passes each row through the provided
cleanup function. We pass all median incomes through `cleanIncome`, salaries
through `cleanSalary`, etc.

To load multiple files, we use `Promise.all` with a list of unresolved
promises. Once resolved, our `.then` handler gets a list of results. We use
array destructuring to expand that list into our respective datasets before
running some more logic to tie them together.

D3 supports formats like `json`, `csv`, `tsv`, `text`, and `xml` out of the
box. You can make it work with custom data sources through the underlying
`request` API.

PS: we're using the shortened salary dataset to make page reloads faster while
building our project.

## Step 4: Tie the datasets together

<Vimeo id={429667661} />

If you add a `console.log` to the `.then` callback above, you'll see a bunch of
data. Each argument - `us`, `countyNames`, `medianIncomes`, `techSalaries`,
`USstateNames` - holds a parsed dataset from the corresponding file.

To tie them together and prepare a dictionary for `setState` back in the `App`
component, we need to add some logic. We're building a dictionary of county
household incomes and removing any empty salaries.

```javascript
// src/DataHandling.js
let [us, countyNames, medianIncomes, techSalaries, USstateNames] = datasets
    let medianIncomesMap = {};

    medianIncomes.filter(d => _.find(countyNames,
                                     {name: d['countyName']}))
                 .forEach((d) => {
                     d['countyID'] = _.find(countyNames,
                                            {name: d['countyName']}).id;
                     medianIncomesMap[d.countyID] = d;
                 });

    techSalaries = techSalaries.filter(d => !_.isNull(d));

    return {
        usTopoJson: us,
        countyNames: countyNames,
        medianIncomes: medianIncomesMap,
        medianIncomesByCounty: _.groupBy(medianIncomes, 'countyName'),
        medianIncomesByUSState: _.groupBy(medianIncomes, 'USstate'),
        techSalaries: techSalaries,
        USstateNames: USstateNames
    }
});

```

Building the income map looks weird because of indentation, but it's not that
bad. We `filter` the `medianIncomes` array to discard any incomes whose
`countyName` we can't find. I made sure they were all unique when I built the
datasets.

We walk through the filtered array with a `forEach`, find the correct
`countyID`, and add each entry to `medianIncomesMap`. When we're done, we have
a large dictionary that maps county ids to their household income data.

Then we filter `techSalaries` to remove any empty values where the
`cleanSalaries` function returned `null`. That happens when a salary is either
undefined or absurdly high.

When our data is ready, we call our `callback` with a dictionary of the new
datasets. To make future access quicker, we use `_.groupBy` to build dictionary
maps of counties by county name and by US state.

You should now see how many salary entries the shortened dataset contains.
