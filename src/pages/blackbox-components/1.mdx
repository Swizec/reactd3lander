# Quickly integrate any D3 code in your React project with Blackbox Components {#blackbox-components}

Blackbox components are the quickest way to integrate D3 and React. You can
think of them as wrappers around D3 visualizations.

With the blackbox approach, you can take any D3 example from the internets or
your brain, wrap it in a React component, and it Just Works™. This is great
when you're in a hurry, but comes with a big caveat: You're letting D3 control
some of the DOM.

D3 controlling the DOM is _okay_, but it means React can't help you there.
That's why it's called a Blackbox – React can't see inside.

No render engine, no tree diffing, no dev tools to inspect what's going. Just a
blob of DOM elements.

Okay for small components or when you're prototyping, but I've had people come
to my workshops and say _"We built our whole app with the blackbox approach. It
takes a few seconds to re-render when you click something. Please help"_

:thinking:

Here's how it works:

- React renders an anchor element
- D3 hijacks it and puts stuff in

You manually re-render on props and state changes. Throwing away and rebuilding
the entire DOM subtree on each render. With complex visualizations this becomes
a huge hit on performance.

Use this technique sparingly.
