# 3 key insights that help you learn D3.js from scratch

<Vimeo id={424609834} />

Somebody once asked me how to learn D3.js from scratch. I quipped that it took
me writing a book to really learn it. It's one hell of a library.

Most people don't go that far. They don't have to.

You start with a problem, find similar examples, do some copy pasta, tweak
until it works and end up with a working visualization you don't understand.
You'd be surprised how few engineers actually understand how their D3 data
visualization works.

Fear not! There are just 3 key concepts you have to grok. Then you can
understand every D3 example out there. 😱

## 1) Data manipulation vs. DOM manipulation

<Vimeo id={424609310} />

All D3 examples are split into two parts:

1. Data manipulation
2. DOM manipulation

First you prep your values, then you render.

You have to go through many examples to notice what's going on. Inference
learning is hard. Most beginners miss this pattern and it makes D3 look more
confusing than it is.

Let's take an example from [D3's docs](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery),
a bar chart with a hover effect.

You can [try it online](https://cdn.rawgit.com/mbostock/3885304/raw/a91f37f5f4b43269df3dbabcda0090310c05285d/index.html).

When you hover on a bar, it changes color. Pretty neat.

Mike Bostock, the creator of D3, built this chart in 43 lines of code. Here
they are 👇

```javascript
var svg = d3.select("svg"),
  margin = { top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 30, left: 40 },
  width = +svg.attr("width") - margin.left - margin.right,
  height = +svg.attr("height") - margin.top - margin.bottom

var x = d3.scaleBand().rangeRound([0, width]).padding(0.1),
  y = d3.scaleLinear().rangeRound([height, 0])

var g = svg
  .append("g")
  .attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.left + "," + margin.top + ")")

d3.tsv(
  "data.tsv",
  function (d) {
    d.frequency = +d.frequency
    return d
  },
  function (error, data) {
    if (error) throw error

    x.domain(
      data.map(function (d) {
        return d.letter
      })
    )
    y.domain([
      0,
      d3.max(data, function (d) {
        return d.frequency
      }),
    ])

    g.append("g")
      .attr("class", "axis axis--x")
      .attr("transform", "translate(0," + height + ")")
      .call(d3.axisBottom(x))

    g.append("g")
      .attr("class", "axis axis--y")
      .call(d3.axisLeft(y).ticks(10, "%"))
      .append("text")
      .attr("transform", "rotate(-90)")
      .attr("y", 6)
      .attr("dy", "0.71em")
      .attr("text-anchor", "end")
      .text("Frequency")

    g.selectAll(".bar")
      .data(data)
      .enter()
      .append("rect")
      .attr("class", "bar")
      .attr("x", function (d) {
        return x(d.letter)
      })
      .attr("y", function (d) {
        return y(d.frequency)
      })
      .attr("width", x.bandwidth())
      .attr("height", function (d) {
        return height - y(d.frequency)
      })
  }
)
```

There are two parts to this code: Data manipulation and DOM manipulation.

```javascript
var // ..,
  margin = { top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 30, left: 40 },
  width = +svg.attr("width") - margin.left - margin.right,
  height = +svg.attr("height") - margin.top - margin.bottom

var x = d3.scaleBand().rangeRound([0, width]).padding(0.1),
  y = d3.scaleLinear().rangeRound([height, 0])

// ...

d3.tsv(
  "data.tsv",
  function (d) {
    d.frequency = +d.frequency
    return d
  },
  function (error, data) {
    if (error) throw error

    x.domain(
      data.map(function (d) {
        return d.letter
      })
    )
    y.domain([
      0,
      d3.max(data, function (d) {
        return d.frequency
      }),
    ])

    // ...
  }
)
```

Bostock here first prepares his data:

- some sizing variables (`margin`, `width`, `height`)
- two scales to help with data-to-coordinates conversion (`x, y`)
- loads his dataset (`d3.tsv`) and updates his scales' domains

In the DOM manipulation part, he puts shapes and objects into an SVG. This is
the part that shows up in your browser.

```javascript
var svg = d3.select("svg"),
    // ..

// ..

var g = svg.append("g")
    .attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.left + "," + margin.top + ")");

// ..
  g.append("g")
      .attr("class", "axis axis--x")
      .attr("transform", "translate(0," + height + ")")
      .call(d3.axisBottom(x));

  g.append("g")
      .attr("class", "axis axis--y")
      .call(d3.axisLeft(y).ticks(10, "%"))
    .append("text")
      .attr("transform", "rotate(-90)")
      .attr("y", 6)
      .attr("dy", "0.71em")
      .attr("text-anchor", "end")
      .text("Frequency");

  g.selectAll(".bar")
    .data(data)
    .enter().append("rect")
      .attr("class", "bar")
      .attr("x", function(d) { return x(d.letter); })
      .attr("y", function(d) { return y(d.frequency); })
      .attr("width", x.bandwidth())
      .attr("height", function(d) { return height - y(d.frequency); });
});
```

DOM manipulation in D3 happens via D3 selections. They're a lot like jQuery
`$(something)`. This is the part we're doing with React later on.

Here Bostock does a few things

- selects the `<svg>` node (`d3.select`)
- appends a grouping `<g>` node (`.append`) with an SVG positioning attribute
  (translate)
- adds a bottom axis by appending a `<g>`, moving it, then calling
  `d3.axisBottom` on it. D3 has built-in axis generators
- adds a left axis using the same approach but rotating the ticks
- appends a text label "Frequency" to the left axis
- uses `selectAll.data` to make a virtual selection of `.bar` nodes and attach
  some data, then for every new data value (.enter), appends a `<rect>` node
  and gives it attributes

That last part is where people get lost. It looks like magic. Even to me.

It's a declarative approach to rendering data. Works great, hard to understand.
That's why we'll do it in React instead 😃

You can think of `.enter` as a loop over your data. Everything chained after
`.enter` is your loop's body. Sort of like doing
`data.map(d => append(rect).setManyAttributes())`

That function executes for any _new_ data "entering" your visualization.
There's also `.exit` for anything that's dropping out, and `.update` for
anything that's changing.

## 2) Scales

<Vimeo id={424608732} />

Scales are D3's most versatile concept. They help you translate between two
different spaces. Like, mathematical spaces.

They're like the mathematical functions you learned about in school. A domain
maps to a range using some sort of formula.

![A basic function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Function_color_example_3.svg/440px-Function_color_example_3.svg.png)

Colored shapes in the domain map to colors in the range. No formula for this
one. That makes it an ordinal scale.

```javascript
let shapes = d3.scaleOrdinal()
  .domain(['red', 'orange', ...)
  .range(['red', 'orange', ...)
```

### Play with scales on CodeSandbox

https://codesandbox.io/s/r0rw72z75o

Once you have this scale, you can use it to translate from shapes to colors.
`shapes('red triangle')` returns `'red'` for example.

Many different types of scales exist. Linear, logarithmic, quantize, etc. Any
basic transformation you can think of exists. The rest you can create by
writing custom scales.

You're most often going to use scales to turn your data values into
coordinates. But other use-cases exist.

## 3) D3 layouts

<Vimeo id={424608430} />

Sure `.enter.append` looks like magic, but D3 layouts are the real mind=blown
of the D3 ecosystem. They take your input data and return a full-featured
visualization thing.

For example, a force layout using forces between nodes to place them on the
screen.

![Force layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/force-layout.png)

Or a circle packing layout that neatly packs circles.

![Circle packing layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/circle-packing-layout.png)

I don't know the maths that goes into most of these. And that's the point, you
shouldn't have to!

Here's a key insight about the magic of layouts: They're the data part.

You take a `forceLayout` and feed it your data. It returns an object with a
`tick` event callback.

```javascript
var simulation = d3
  .forceSimulation()
  .force(
    "link",
    d3.forceLink().id(function (d) {
      return d.id
    })
  )
  .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody())
  .force("center", d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2))
```

This `simulation` now handles everything _about_ rendering your nodes. Changes
their positions on every `tick` callback, figures out how often to change
stuff, etc.

But it is up to you to render them. A layout handles your dataviz in the
abstract. You're in control of the rendering.

For a force layout, you have to update the DOM on every tick of the animation.
For circle packing, you render it once.

Once you grok this, all the fancy visualizations out there start making sense.
Also means you can use these fancy layouts in React 🙌
