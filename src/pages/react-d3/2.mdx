# What about existing libraries?

<Vimeo id={424607580} />

The quickest way to achieve the benefits of integrating React with D3 is to use
a library. A collection of components with pre-built charting visualizations.
Plug it into your app, move on with life.

Great option for basic charts. I recommend it dearly to anyone who comes to me
and asks about building stuff. Try a library first. If it fits your needs,
perfect! You just saved yourselves plenty of time.

Where libraries become a problem is when you want to move beyond the library
author's idea of How Things Are Done. Custom features, visualizations that
aren't just charts, disabling this or that default behavior ... it gets messy.

That's why I rarely use libraries myself. Often find it quicker to build
something specific from scratch than figuring out how to hold a generalized API
just right.

But they're a great first step. Here's a few of the most popular React & D3
libraries ðŸ‘‡

List borrowed from [a wonderful Smashing Magazine article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/react-d3-ecosystem/), because it's a good list.

## Victory.js

<Vimeo id={424607409} />

> React.js components for modular charting and data visualization

[![Victory.js logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hsribei/react-d3js-es6-ebook/teachable-only/manuscript/resources/images/2018/victoryjs.jpg)](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/)

Victory offers low level components for basic charting and reimplements a lot
of D3's API. Great when you need to create basic charts without a lot of
customization. Supports React Native.

Here's what it takes to implement a Barchart using Victory.js.
[You can try it on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/3v3q013x36)

https://codesandbox.io/s/3v3q013x36

```javascript
const data = [
  { quarter: 1, earnings: 13000 },
  { quarter: 2, earnings: 16500 },
  { quarter: 3, earnings: 14250 },
  { quarter: 4, earnings: 19000 },
]

const App = () => (
  <div style={styles}>
    <h1>Victory basic demo</h1>
    <VictoryChart domainPadding={20}>
      <VictoryBar data={data} x="quarter" y="earnings" />
    </VictoryChart>
  </div>
)
```

Create some fake data, render a `<VictoryChart>` rendering area, add a
`<VictoryBar>` component, give it data and axis keys. Quick and easy.

My favorite feature of Victory is that components use fake random data until
you pass your own. Means you always know what to expect.

## Recharts

<Vimeo id={424607342} />

> A composable charting library built on React components

[![Recharts homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/recharts.png)](https://recharts.org/)

Recharts is like a more colorful Victory. A pile of charting components, some
customization, loves animating everything by default.

Here's what it takes to implement a Barchart using Recharts.
[You can try it on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/mmkrjl7qxp)

https://codesandbox.io/s/mmkrjl7qxp

```javascript
const data = [
  { quarter: 1, earnings: 13000 },
  { quarter: 2, earnings: 16500 },
  { quarter: 3, earnings: 14250 },
  { quarter: 4, earnings: 19000 },
]

const App = () => (
  <div style={styles}>
    <h1>Recharts basic demo</h1>
    <BarChart width={500} height={300} data={data}>
      <XAxis dataKey="quarter" />
      <YAxis dataKey="earnings" />
      <Bar dataKey="earnings" />
    </BarChart>
  </div>
)
```

More involved than Victory, but same principle. Fake some data, render a
drawing area this time with `<BarChart>` and feed it some data. Inside the
`<BarChart>` render two axes, and a `<Bar>` for each entry.

Recharts hits a great balance of flexibility and ease ... unless you don't like
animation by default. Then you're in trouble.

_PS: Recharts v2 is currently in beta. The API of how it works might soon change_

## Nivo

<Vimeo id={424607198} />

> nivo provides a rich set of dataviz components, built on top of the awesome
> d3 and Reactjs libraries.

[![Nivo homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/nivo.gif)](https://nivo.rocks/)

Nivo is another attempt to give you a set of basic charting components. Comes
with great interactive documentation, support for Canvas and API rendering.
Plenty of basic customization.

Here's what it takes to implement a Barchart using Nivo.
[You can try it on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/n1wwkvq24)

https://codesandbox.io/s/n1wwkvq24

```javascript
const data = [
  { quarter: 1, earnings: 13000 },
  { quarter: 2, earnings: 16500 },
  { quarter: 3, earnings: 14250 },
  { quarter: 4, earnings: 19000 },
]

const App = () => (
  <div style={styles}>
    <h1>Nivo basic demo</h1>
    <div style={{ height: "400px" }}>
      <ResponsiveBar data={data} keys={["earnings"]} indexBy="quarter" />
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

Least amount of effort! You render a `<ResponsiveBar>` component, give it data
and some params, and Nivo handles the rest.

Wonderful! But means you have to learn a whole new language of configs and
props that might make your hair stand on end. The documentation is great and
shows how everything works, but I found it difficult to know which prop
combinations are valid.

## VX

<Vimeo id={424607095} />

> vx is collection of reusable low-level visualization components. vx combines
> the power of d3 to generate your visualization with the benefits of react for
> updating the DOM.

[![VX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/vx.png)](https://vx-demo.now.sh/)

VX is the closest to the approaches you're learning in this book. React for
rendering, D3 for calculations. When you build a set of custom components for
your organization, a flavor of VX is what you often come up with.

That's why I recommend teams use VX when they need to get started quickly.

Here's what it takes to implement a Barchart using Nivo.
[You can try it on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/k5853pryrv)

https://codesandbox.io/s/k5853pryrv

```javascript
const data = [
  { quarter: 1, earnings: 13000 },
  { quarter: 2, earnings: 16500 },
  { quarter: 3, earnings: 14250 },
  { quarter: 4, earnings: 19000 }
];

const App = ({ width = 400, height = 400 }) => {
  const xMax = width;
  const yMax = height - 120;

  const x = d => d.quarter;
  const y = d => d.earnings;

  // scales
  const xScale = scaleBand({
    rangeRound: [0, xMax],
    domain: data.map(:satisfied:,
    padding: 0.4
  });
  const yScale = scaleLinear({
    rangeRound: [yMax, 0],
    domain: [0, max(data, y)]
  });

  return (
    <div style={styles}>
      <h1>VX basic demo</h1>
      <svg width={width} height={height}>
        {data.map((d, i) => {
          const barHeight = yMax - yScale(y(d));
          return (
            <Bar
              width={xScale.bandwidth()}
              height={barHeight}
              x={xScale(x(d))}
              y={yMax - barHeight}
              data={{ x: x(d), y: y(d) }}
            />
          );
        })}
      </svg>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Move involved than previous examples, but means you have more control and fight
the library less often. VX does the tedious stuff for you, so you can focus on
the stuff that matters.

This code creates value accessor methods, D3 scales, then iterates over an
array of `data` and renders a `<Bar>` for each. The bar gets a bunch of props.
