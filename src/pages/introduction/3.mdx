## How to approach React for Data Visualization

<Vimeo id={424598481} />

I recommend starting with an idea, a problem. Something you want to build. A
dataset you want to play with. A feature you want to add to your app.

That makes it easier. Helps focus your brain. Notice things in this course that
help _you_ specifically.

From there, I think you should see how much time you've got. The course is
designed so you can go over the important stuff in a couple hours. Watch a
video, read some text, try some code. See how it feels.

If the best way is a daily practice, 20 minutes after work, 5 minutes on the
pooper, do that. If you're more of a sit down and cram it out kind of person, a
nice Sunday afternoon with some coffee will do just fine.

But don't make it a chore. We're here to have fun 😃

Two suggestions ✌️:

1. _Try_ the example code. Don’t just copy-paste; type it and execute it.
   Execute frequently. If something doesn’t fit together, look at the linked
   Github repositories or solved CodeSandboxes. Each project has one.
2. If you know something, skip that section. You’re awesome. :heart:

React + D3 is based on code samples. They look like this:

```javascript
let foo = "bar"
foo += "more stuff"
```

Each code sample starts with a commented out file path. That's the file you're
editing. Like this:

```javascript
// ./src/App.js

class App ...
```

Commands that you should run in the terminal start with an `$` symbol, like
this:

```
$ npm start
```
