# Introduction

Hello new friend! üëã

![This is me, speaking at Write The Docs Prague in 2015](../../images/course/swizec.jpg)

Welcome to what I hope is the best and most fun React and D3 learning resource
on the internet. No TODO apps here, just fun interactive stuff that makes you
look great at a dinner party.

After an hour with _React for Dataviz_, you‚Äôll know how to make React and D3.js play
together. You‚Äôll know how to create composable data visualizations. Understand
_why_ that‚Äôs a good idea, and you will have the tools to build your own library
of interactive visualization components. Or use _and understand_ somebody
else's.

It's going to be fun!

I believe learning new tech should be exciting, so I did my best to inject joy
whenever I could.

250+ pages as a book, 8 example apps, near 8 hours of video, a bunch of skill
building blocks. üëå

Going through this course you will:

- build a bunch of reusable visualization components
- build an interactive data dashboard
- learn about reusable animation components
- learn the basics of D3.js
- master React
- learn the basics of Redux and MobX
- look into rendering rich animations on canvas
- learn about server-side rendering
- learn a few basics of data science
- learn some WebGL and 3D rendering

You might be thinking _"How the hell does this all fit together to help me
build interactive graphs and charts?"_. They're building blocks!

First I will show you the basics. Stuff like how to make React and D3 like each
other, how to approach rendering, what to do with state.

Then you'll build a big project to see how it all fits together.

When you're comfortable with React and D3 working together, I will show you
animation. Cool things like how to approach updating components with fine
grained control and how to do transitions. I'll show you how tricks from the
gaming industry work on the web.

Short on time? Don't worry.

The initial examples work in CodeSandbox, a web-based IDE. Read the
explanation, run the code, master enough React to be dangerous. You won't even
have to leave the browser.

In about an hour, you'll know React and D3 well enough to explore on your own,
to sell the tech to your boss and your team, and to assess if the React+D3
combination fits your needs.

I believe learning new tech should be exciting.

# Foreword

I wrote the first version of React+D3 in Spring 2015 as a dare. Can I learn a
thing and write a book in a month? Yes.

That first version was 91 pages long and sold a few hundred copies. Great
success!

You are reading, and watching, the pinnacle of how this material has evolved
over 5 years. 5 years I've been working on this. Not every day, not all
the time.

Little experiments here and there, launches and relaunches about once a year.
Learning how to do video, exploring new approaches, hosting in-person
workshops.

A lot has changed.

React isn't what it used to be. The internals are different, the API is easier
to use. Hooks flipped everything on its head all over again. Suspense and
async rendering are coming soon.

D3 has seen less change, but still went through major improvements. It's easier
to use now. Easier to understand. More modern.

It feels like the web development world is a different place in late 2020 than
it was in early 2015. It really does. Look at my code from 5 years ago and I
think _"What!? We used to live like this? This is horrible"_

Almost 200 people bought this version of React+D3 in preorders alone. It
started as a book update and grew into a proper online course.

If you're one of those early supporters, thank you! You are the best. Without
you this never would have happened. üôèüèª
