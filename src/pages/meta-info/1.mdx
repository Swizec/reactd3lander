<Vimeo id={431832887} />

You've come so far! There's a US map and a histogram. They're blue and shiny
and you look at them and you go _"Huh?"_.

The key to a good data visualization is telling users what it means. An easy
way to do that is a good title and description. Just tell them. The picture
supports the words, the words explain the picture.

Let's add those words.

We're adding a dynamic title and description, and a median line on the
histogram. The text is dynamic because we're adding user controls later, and we
want the pictures and the words to stay in sync.

At the end of this section, you'll have a full visualization of the shortened
dataset.

## Dynamic title

<Vimeo id={431833041} />

We begin with the title because it shows up first.

We start with an import in `App.js` and add it to the render method. You know
the drill ðŸ˜„

```javascript
// src/App.js
import CountyMap from "./components/CountyMap"
import Histogram from "./components/Histogram"
// Insert the line(s) between here...
import { Title } from "./components/Meta"
// ...and here.

function App() {
    const [datasets, setDatasets] = useState({
        techSalaries: [],
        medianIncomes: [],
        countyNames: [],
        usTopoJson: null,
        USstateNames: null,
    });
    // Insert the line(s) between here...
    const [filteredBy, setFilteredBy] = useState({
        USstate: "*",
        year: "*",
        jobTitle: "*",
    });
    // ...and here.
  }

  // ...

    return (
      <div className="App container">
        // Insert the line(s) between here...
        <Title data={filteredSalaries} filteredBy={filteredBy} />
        // ...and here. // ...
      </div>
    )
}
```

Ok, I lied. We did a lot more than just imports and adding to render.

We also set up the `App` component for future user-controlled data filtering.
The `filteredBy` state tells us what the user is filtering by â€“ 3
options: `USstate`, `year`, and `jobTitle`. We set them to "everything" by
default.

We added them now so that we can immediately write our `Title` component in a
filterable way. No need to make changes later.

As you can see, `Title` takes `data` and `filteredBy` props.

### Get the USStatesMap file

You need the `USStatesMap` file.

It's a big dictionary that translates US state codes to full names. You can
[get it from Github](https://github.com/Swizec/react-d3-walkthrough-livecode/raw/3b1052fe3f70ab12142e5aac684b95ed430b12b2/src/components/Meta/USStatesMap.js)
and save it as `components/Meta/USStatesMap.js`.

We'll use it when creating titles and descriptions.

### Implement Title

<Vimeo id={431834731} />

We're building two types of titles based on user selection. If both `years` and
`US state` were selected, we return
`In {US state}, the average {job title} paid ${mean}/year in {year}`. If not,
we return `{job title} paid ${mean}/year in {state} in {year}`.

I know, it's confusing. They look like the same sentence turned around. Notice
the _and_. First option when _both_ are selected, second when either/or.

We start with imports, a stub, and an export.

```javascript
// src/components/Meta.js
import React, { Component } from "react"
import { scaleLinear } from "d3-scale"
import { mean as d3mean, extent as d3extent } from "d3-array"

import USStatesMap from "./USStatesMap"

export const Title = ({ filteredSalaries, filteredBy }) => {}
```

We import only what we need from D3's `d3-scale` and `d3-array` packages. I
consider this best practice until you're importing so much that it gets messy
to look at.

#### The helper methods

1. `yearsFragment` describes the selected year
2. `USstateFragment` describes the selected US state
3. `jobTitleFragment` describes the selected job title
4. `format` returns a number formatter

We can implement `yearsFragment`, `USstateFragment`, and `format` in one code
sample. They're short.

```javascript
// src/components/Meta.js
export const Title = ({ filteredSalaries, filteredBy }) => {
    function yearsFragment() {
        const year = filteredBy.year;
        return year === "*" ? "" : `in ${year}`;
    }

    function USstateFragment() {
        const USstate = filteredBy.USstate;
        return USstate === "*" ? "" : USStatesMap[USstate.toUpperCase()];
    }

    function format() {
        return scaleLinear()
            .domain(d3extent(filteredSalaries, (d) => d.base_salary))
            .tickFormat();
    }
```

In both `yearsFragment` and `USstateFragment`, we get the appropriate value
from Title's `filteredBy` prop, then return a string with the value or an empty
string.

We rely on D3's built-in number formatters to build `format`. Linear scales
have the one that turns `10000` into `10,000`. Tick formatters don't work well
without a `domain`, so we define it. We don't need a range because we never use
the scale itself.

`format` returns a function, which makes it a
[higher order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function).
Being a getter makes it really nice to use: `this.format()`. Looks just like a
normal function call ðŸ˜„

The `jobTitleFragment` is conceptually no harder than `yearsFragment`
and `USstateFragment`, but it comes with a few more conditionals.

```javascript
// src/components/Meta.js

export const Title = ({ filteredSalaries, filteredBy }) => {
  // ...
  function jobTitleFragment() {
    const { jobTitle, year } = filteredBy
    let title = ""

    if (jobTitle === "*") {
      if (year === "*") {
        title = "The average H1B in tech pays"
      } else {
        title = "The average tech H1B paid"
      }
    } else {
      title = `Software ${jobTitle}s on an H1B`

      if (year === "*") {
        title += " make"
      } else {
        title += " made"
      }
    }

    return title
  }
  // ...
}
```

We're dealing with the `(jobTitle, year)` combination. Each influences the
other when building the fragment for a total 4 different options.

#### The render

<Vimeo id={431835247} />

We put all this together in the `render` method. A conditional decides which of
the two situations we're in, and we return an `<h2>` tag with the right text.

```javascript
// src/components/Title.js
export const Title = ({ filteredSalaries, filteredBy }) => {
  // ...
  const mean = format()(d3mean(filteredSalaries, (d) => d.base_salary))

  let title

  if (yearsFragment() && USstateFragment()) {
    title = (
      <h2>
        In {USstateFragment()}, {jobTitleFragment()}${mean}/year{" "}
        {yearsFragment()}
      </h2>
    )
  } else {
    title = (
      <h2>
        {jobTitleFragment()} ${mean}/year
        {USstateFragment() ? `in ${USstateFragment()}` : ""}
        {yearsFragment()}
      </h2>
    )
  }
  return title
}
```

Calculate the mean value using `d3.mean` with a value accessor, turn it into a
pretty number with `format()`, then use one of two string patterns to make a
`title`.

And a title appears after a little debugging.

## Dynamic description

<Vimeo id={431835684} />

You know what? The dynamic description component is pretty much the same as the
title. It's just longer and more complex and uses more code. It's interesting,
but not super relevant to the topic of this book.

So rather than explain it all here, I'm going to give you a link to the
[diff on Github](https://github.com/Swizec/reactdataviz-project/commit/ebbe0d490496fa2186ba8908264cfe931dc7165f)

We use the same approach as before:

1. Add imports in `App.js`
2. Add component to `App` render
3. Implement component in `components/Meta.js`
4. Use getters for sentence fragments
5. Play with conditionals to construct different sentences

142 lines of mundane code.

All the interesting complexity goes into finding the richest city and county.
That part looks like this:

```javascript
// src/components/Meta/Description.js
get countyFragment() {
  const byCounty = _.groupBy(this.props.data, 'countyID'),
        medians = this.props.medianIncomesByCounty;

  let ordered = _.sortBy(
      _.keys(byCounty)
       .map(county => byCounty[county])
       .filter(d => d.length/this.props.data.length > 0.01),
      items => d3mean(items,
                      d => d.base_salary) - medians[items[0].countyID][0].medianIncome);

  let best = ordered[ordered.length-1],
      countyMedian = medians[best[0].countyID][0].medianIncome;

  // ...
}
```

We group the dataset by county, then sort counties by their income delta. We
look only at counties that are bigger than 1% of the entire dataset. And we
define income delta as the difference between a county's median household
income and the median tech salary in our dataset.

This code is not super efficient, but it gets the job done. We could optimize
by just looking for the max value, for example.

Similar code handles finding the best city.

### Render the description

I recommend copying the
[`Description` component from GitHub](https://github.com/Swizec/reactdataviz-project/commit/ebbe0d490496fa2186ba8908264cfe931dc7165f).
Most of it has little to do with React and data visualization. It's all about
combining sentence fragments based on props.

You then render the Description like this:

```javascript
// src/components/App.js

import { Title, Description } from "./components/Meta"

// ..
;<Description
  data={filteredSalaries}
  allData={techSalaries}
  filteredBy={filteredBy}
  medianIncomesByCounty={this.state.medianIncomesByCounty}
/>
```

![Dataviz with Title and Description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/dataviz-with-description.png)

## Overlay a median household line

Here's a more interesting component: the median dotted line. It shows a direct
comparison between the histogram's distribution and the median household income
in an area. I'm not sure people understand it at a glance, but I think it's
cool.

We're using a quick approach where everything fits into a functional React
component. It's great for small components like this.

### Step 1: App.js

<Vimeo id={431835935} />

Inside `src/App.js`, we first have to add an import, then extract the median
household value from state, and in the end, add `MedianLine` to the render
method.

Let's see if we can do it in a single code block ðŸ˜„

```javascript
// src/App.js
import Histogram from './components/Histogram';
import { Title, Description, GraphDescription } from './components/Meta';
// Insert the line(s) between here...
import MedianLine from './components/MedianLine';
// ...and here.

function App() {
        // ...
        let zoom = null,
            // Insert the line(s) between here...
            medianHousehold = this.state.medianIncomesByUSState['US'][0]
                                  .medianIncome;
            // ...and here.

        return (
            // ...
            <svg width="1100" height="500">
                <CountyMap // ... />
                <Histogram // ... />
                // Insert the line(s) between here...
                <MedianLine data={filteredSalaries}
                            x={500}
                            y={10}
                            width={600}
                            height={500}
                            bottomMargin={5}
                            median={medianHousehold}
                            value={d => d.base_salary} />
                // ...and here.
            </svg>
        )
}
```

You probably don't remember `medianIncomesByUSState` anymore. We set it up way
back when
[tying datasets together](https://swizec1.teachable.com/courses/react-for-data-visualization/lectures/6888897#tie-datasets-together).
It groups our salary data by US state.

See, using good names helps ðŸ˜„

When rendering `MedianLine`, we give it sizing and positioning props, the
dataset, a `value` accessor, and the median value to show. We could make it
smart enough to calculate the median, but the added flexibility of a prop felt
right.

### Step 2: MedianLine

<Vimeo id={431836837} />

The `MedianLine` component looks similar to what you've seen so far. Some
imports, a `constructor` that sets up D3 objects, an `updateD3` method that
keeps them in sync, and a `render` method that outputs SVG.

```javascript
// src/components/MedianLine.js

import React from "react"
import * as d3 from "d3"

const MedianLine = ({
  data,
  value,
  width,
  height,
  x,
  y,
  bottomMargin,
  median,
}) => {}

export default MedianLine
```

We have some imports, a functional `MedianLine` component that takes our props,
and an export. It should cause an error because it's not returning anything.

Everything we need to render the line, fits into this function.

```javascript
// src/components/MedianLine.js

const MedianLine = (
  {
    // ...
  }
) => {
  const yScale = d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain([0, d3.max(data, value)])
      .range([height - y - bottomMargin, 0]),
    line = d3.line()([
      [0, 5],
      [width, 5],
    ])

  const medianValue = median || d3.median(data, value)

  const translate = `translate(${x}, ${yScale(medianValue)})`,
    medianLabel = `Median Household: $${yScale.tickFormat()(median)}`

  return (
    <g className="mean" transform={translate}>
      <text
        x={width - 5}
        y="0"
        textAnchor="end"
        style={{ background: "purple" }}
      >
        {medianLabel}
      </text>
      <path d={line} />
    </g>
  )
}
```

We start with a scale for vertical positioning â€“Â `yScale`. It's linear, takes
values from `0` to `max`, and translates them to pixels less some margin. For
the `medianValue`, we use props, or calculate our own, if needed. Just like I
promised.

A `translate` SVG transform helps us position our line and label. We use it all
to return a `<g>` grouping element containing a `<text>` for our label, and a
`<path>` for the line.

Building the `d` attribute for the path, that's interesting. We use a `line`
generator from D3.

```javascript
line = d3.line()([
  [0, 5],
  [width, 5],
])
```

It comes from the [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#lines) package and
generates splines, or polylines. By default, it takes an array of points and
builds a line through all of them. A line from `[0, 5]` to `[width, 5]` in our
case.

That makes it span the entire width and leaves 5px for the label. We're using a
`transform` on the entire group to vertically position the final element.

Remember, we already styled `medianLine` when we built
[histogram styles](https://swizec1.teachable.com/courses/react-for-data-visualization/lectures/6888921#histogram-css)
earlier.

```{.css caption="Histogram css"}
.mean text {
    font: 11px sans-serif;
    fill: grey;
}

.mean path {
    stroke-dasharray: 3;
    stroke: grey;
    stroke-width: 1px;
}
```

The `stroke-dasharray` is what makes it dashed. `3` means each `3px` dash is
followed by a `3px` blank. You can use
[any pattern you like](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray).

You should see a median household salary line overlaid on your histogram.

![Median line over histogram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/es6v2/dataviz-with-everything.png)

Almost everyone in tech makes more than an entire median household. Crazy, huh?
I think it is.

If that didn't work, consult the
[diff on Github](https://github.com/Swizec/reactdataviz-project/commit/ebbe0d490496fa2186ba8908264cfe931dc7165f).
