          <p>
            React+D3 started as a bet in April 2015. A friend wanted to learn
            React and challenged me to publish a book. A month later React+D3
            launched with 79 pages of hard earned knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            In April 2016 it became <strong>React+D3</strong> ES6. 117 pages
            and growing beyond a single big project it was a huge success. I
            kept going, started live streaming, and publishing videos on
            YouTube.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2017, after 10 months of work, <strong>React + D3v4</strong>{' '}
            became the best book I'd ever written. At 249 pages, many examples,
            and code to play with it was designed like a step-by-step course.
            But I felt something was missing.
          </p>

          <p>
            So in late 2018 I rebuilt the entire thing as{' '}
            <a href="https://reactfordataviz.com">
              React for Data Visualization
            </a>{' '}
            &mdash; a proper video course. Designed for busy people with real
            lives like you. Over 8 hours of video material, split into chunks
            no longer than 5 minutes, a bunch of new chapters, and techniques I
            discovered along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>React for Data Visualization</strong> is the best way to
            learn how to build scalable dataviz components your whole team can
            understand.
